# Flatiron E-commerce App - Backend

## Learning Goals

Yes to the Dress is an e-commerce platform that lets the user interact and shop for wedding dresses; allowing the user to browse the catalog, and checkout using a shopping cart - created by members of Flatiron School.

Users will be able to:

* User will land on the homepage, where they can browse the catalog of wedding dresses available 
* User can filter through the different dresses using the Search bar via, various critera
* Users can add dresses to a shopping cart 
* Users can navigate the Home page, shopping cart, and About page via the Nav Bar

Technologies used: Our frontend was built with React.js and communicates with our Sinatra backend API that uses Active Record

This project was created using 
- [create-react-app][]
- [dbdiagram.io][]
- [Postman][postman download]

## Goals

Our goal is to build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React frontend and simulate a professional work environment:

* Use Active Record to interact with a database.
* Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship.
* set up the following API routes in Sinatra:
  - create and read actions for both models
  - full CRUD capability for one of the models
* Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
* Use good OO design patterns that has separate classes for each of our models, and create instance and class methods.

### Stretch Goals

* Create a login page that allows the user to register for an account, save their data in the API
* Mock payment transaction

## Expected Accomplishments

* Get all core deliverables
* Presentable web page 

## Challenges We Expect to Face

* Connecting all databases together, using CRUD
* CSS and web styling/aesthetics

### Backend Setup

This repository has all the starter code needed to get a Sinatra backend up and
running. [**Fork and clone**][fork link] this repository to get started. Then, run
`bundle install` to install the gems.

You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

<!-- ## Project Tips

- This project is intended to focus more on the backend than the frontend, so
  try and keep the React side of things relatively simple. Focus on working with
  Active Record and performing CRUD actions. What are some interesting queries you can write? What kinds of questions can you ask of your data?
- Once you have a project idea, come up with a domain model and decide what
  relationships exist between the models in your application. Use a tool like
  [dbdiagram.io][] to help visualize your models.
- Decide on your API endpoints. What data should they return? What kind of CRUD
  action should they perform? What data do they need from the client?
- Use [Postman][postman download] to test your endpoints.
- Use `binding.pry` to debug your requests on the server. It's very helpful to use a
  `binding.pry` in your controller within a route to see what `params` are being
  sent.
- Use the [Network Tab in the Dev Tools][network tab] in the frontend to debug
  your requests. -->
